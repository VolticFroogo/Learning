# Froogo's Learning Bin
Just my bucket of code I used / made / edited while learning.

## Production

I wouldn't recommend basing your projects off anything in here.
You could definitely implement things in here to your projects though.

But, before you implement security aspects such as [custom token auth](Go/Token-Auth) or [JWT](Go/JWT) make sure these are the latest secure protocols. As I'm not going to update these like they're a project they'll likely have exploits over time.
